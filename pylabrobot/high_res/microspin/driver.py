"""Driver for the HighRes Biosolutions MicroSpin, a two-bucket microplate centrifuge.

The MicroSpin answers a text protocol on TCP port 1000. Each command is a line ending `\\r\\n`; the
device answers `ACK! <command> <id>`, then any data lines, then exactly one of `OK!`, `ERROR!` or
`ABORTED!`, each followed by the command and its id.

The device answers one command at a time on each connection, and keeps one state across all of
them. `home`, `open`, `spin` and `status` wait their turn on the machine and do not finish until
the rotor and door have stopped, so this driver holds two connections: one for those, and one for
the commands answered at once, so that `abort` reaches the device while a spin is running.

After an `abort` the rotor coasts to a stop: about 40 s from 320 rpm and 110 s from 500 x g on a
device. A command sent to the machine in that time can leave the device answering nothing that
waits its turn until it is power-cycled, so this driver sends none until the spindle reads stopped.
